# Antigravity Instructions

## Repo / Branch Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **Authoritative remote:** `https://github.com/vzwjustin/Auto-Claude.git`
- **Authoritative branch:** `user/justin`
- **Default:** do not push to or create PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`.
- **Exception:** only push to / create PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude` when the user explicitly requests it.

### Git behavior

- If the clone has an `origin` remote pointing to `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`, do not use it for pushes.
- Ensure local `user/justin` tracks `vzwjustin/user/justin`.
- All changes must be committed and pushed to `vzwjustin/user/justin` only.
