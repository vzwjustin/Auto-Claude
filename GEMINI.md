## Repo / Branch Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **Authoritative remote:** `https://github.com/vzwjustin/Auto-Claude.git`
- **Authoritative branch:** `develop`
- **Forbidden:** pushing to or creating PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`.

### Git behavior

- If the clone has an `origin` remote pointing to `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`, do not use it for pushes.
- Ensure local `develop` tracks `vzwjustin/develop`.
- All changes must be committed and pushed to `vzwjustin/develop` only.
