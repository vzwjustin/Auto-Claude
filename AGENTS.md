# Agent Instructions

## Repo / Branch Policy (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **Authoritative remote:** `https://github.com/vzwjustin/Auto-Claude.git`
- **Authoritative branch:** `develop`
- **Forbidden:** pushing to or creating PRs against `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`.

### Git expectations

- The local branch `develop` should track `vzwjustin/develop`.
- If a local clone has `origin` pointing to `AndyMik90/Auto-Claude`, do not use it for pushes.

### Default behavior

- All changes must be committed and pushed to `vzwjustin/develop` only.
- If a task would require pushing elsewhere, stop and ask for clarification.
